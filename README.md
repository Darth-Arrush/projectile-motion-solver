# projectile-motion-solver
Solver for Projectile Motion Questions. Takes relevant inputs and gives value as decimal.
_**Do not use for symbolic answer, only for decimal**_

Install as in github.com/Darth-Arrush/linalg, use.

Dependencies: Go/Golang, fmt, math. I cannot remove fmt import as it causes some weird bug not allowing me to create functions.
